"This simple tool has been developed to work offline and is designed exclusively for Itel, Tecno, and Infinix phones equipped with SPD processors.

How to Use:
Press all three buttons together (usually Volume Down + Power Button + Volume Up, depending on the phone model).
Connect the phone to the computer using a USB cable.
The ADB option will be enabled automatically on the phone.
When a notification appears asking for Developer Options permission, click "Allow."
Once the phone is detected by the program, click the Remove FRP button to remove the lock.
The tool is user-friendly and specifically designed for the supported devices."
